#+TITLE: Data files

This folder contains data files.

The subfolder ~component_contribution~ has files copied from the
[[https://gitlab.com/equilibrator/component-contribution][~component-contribution~]] repository.

Files with the extension ~.csv~ are outputs of the script ~fetch_data.py~ from
the parent directory.

Files with names like ~input_data.json~ are outputs of the script
~prepare_data.py~ from the parent directory, and specify inputs to Stan models.

There may also be files with names like ~init.json~ which contain initial
values for parameters.
